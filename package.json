  "description": "- Fork the repository - Create a Feature Branch - Implement a simple search function according to wireframes and UI (attached) - The search should use a public REST API of your choice using JavaScript - Search for title, return title (or something like that) - Display partial search results in a list beneath the search field - When hitting [ENTER] the selected search value should be saved with date/timestamp beneath the search box (as a search history) - The page should be responsive, so that if width of window is changed it should adapt - Nothing needs to be saved if the page is reloaded (i.e donï¿½t have to use cookies/database etc) - Logo and search-icon is provided under /assets - We expect a total of 3 files - .html, .js and .css - Solutions built using frameworks such as flex-grid, bootstrap or similar will be discarded. - Please don't use build scripts, tooling, packages or JQuery. Keep it as simple as possible. - A small css reset is fine.",
